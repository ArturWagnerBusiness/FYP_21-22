# Final Year Project 2021/2022

This is a react front end that will be connecting with a express backend to auth users and get data from a database.

There are 2 folders `./front-end` is a pure react app that can be build into `./front-end/build`

In `./back-end` an express app will read the `./front-end/build` directory to run the react app on top of the server.
